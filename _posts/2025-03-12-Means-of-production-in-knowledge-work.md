title: Means of production in knowledge work

>What are the means of production for the work I do? Certainly myself, my experience, and my knowledge. But also physical means, like a computer, electricity, an office space, etc. And on top of that services like internet, cloud providers, and third party systems. Which ones do I own, and which ones do my employer? There is where the balance of power lies.

Let's unravel that Graf.

Without much nuance, we can say that owning the means of production is a core concept of capitalism. The ones with the capital to invest normally own those means. The rest are salaried workers. That only own their time to be "rented" to the capital owners in exchange for a salary. Creating a dual class system: capitalists and proletariat.

That distinction held well in an industrial world. But with the advent of *knowledge work* this distinction becomes murkier. Not the class system, but the ownership of means of production. Hence, the Graf above.

Now, we can certainly say that I own all the means related to myself (experience, knowledge, etc.). And if you factor working from home, or even hybrid work, I also own many of those offices type of means. Which leaves only cloud and third party services in the hands of the capitalist. Oh, and most importantly, the intellectual property of the product being developed. And that's what's most valuable of all as it turns out.

Because we can argue that even those cloud and third party services are simply rented for a fee. No matter how high. So I could, as a worker, own them too. And many of us do, for side projects. So is that intellectual property that keeps the class difference in a capitalist system standing.

Not only that. Even though I own myself and my means of production, and I can also own those services needed to provide a product to the market. I would need capital to be able to rent other's time to help me deliver that product or service. Solopreneurship can only go so far.

Regardless, in the knowledge work industry, we workers have gained a great amount of bargaining power. So much so, that in the past year we have seen a big swing from businesses trying to recoup those powers back.

Where to from here? I don't know. These are just some reflections on this subject. But reflections I think are worth keeping in mind. Specially at times like these.
