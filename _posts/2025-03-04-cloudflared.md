My <a href="{{'/post/self-hosting-mini-weekend-project' | relative_url}}">mini project</a> to self host my digital assets concluded with a very clunky setup. The main issue was the proxying of traffic to my MacMini (the server) via my router's port forwarding capabilities.

This is what the setup looked like:

After posting about some thoughts early this week, some things became apparent. Besides the security considerations, this router port forwarding setup was not reliable enough. I heard from several people that the blog was unreachable üòû.

So with some suggestions from Bsky friends, I dived into CloudFlare.

Now, I should have done this from the get go. But I wanted to go as far as possible with just what I had at home.

Without having used CloudFlare before, I jumped into its [tunnel documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). Their documentation is pretty great, so things got underway. But not without hiccups.

After transferring the nameservers from my DNS provider to CloudFlare, I got into setting up the tunnel. This was fairly straight forward. Installed their `cloudflared` app using homebrew. And everything was ready to go.

The challenges came along with my Nginx configuration. I had to mess around with it running as root to enable port 443 when I set up LetsEncrypt certificates before. And trying to revert to a non-root user to run it got bumpy. 

Somehow I was able to get one of my apps working, but not all of them. I couldn't understand what was going on. It was like my Nginx config changes were not taking effect. So finally I decided to do the simple thing and restart my MacMini. After that, I got Docker running and Nginx as a non-root user. And everything started working.

So here is the final setup. A lot more robust and reliable. And without too much effort in the end ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
