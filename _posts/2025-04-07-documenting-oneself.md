One reflection while writing my [[Handover documents]] as I exit my current role, is that it would be far more useful to have done it along the way. And as I'm about to embark on a new role, how can I apply this reflection to improve.
I have in the past experimented with [User Manuals](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/my-user-manual). But that seemed too *performative* and one-directional. And didn't really bring much use beyond the act of writing it. Which I guess helped as a self-reflection exercise.
This time I want to write an actual "manual" of how I do my job. Capture the details of different activities, and the expected outcomes.
