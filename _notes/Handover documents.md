Writing handover documents after giving a resignation notice is not great. A lot of nuance gets skipped over. And many details can be missed. A better approach could be to write a manual for your role as you perform it. This will not only help with those handover documents, but also help you improve your craft. Writing things down can help you think those things through more deeply. And give you the opportunity to reflect on them.
