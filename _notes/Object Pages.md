I discovered a great system to keep physical notes. It's called [Object Pages](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/object-pages-a-free-simple-physical-notes-system/). The premise is very simple, keep one note per page, add some [Fontmatter](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/what-exactly-is-frontmatter/), and that's it. The idea of one topic per page is that you can always come back later to add more to it and not worry about not having space. And if you need more than one page, you can always have a 1/n type of situation. I'm trying it on a lovely A6 midori notebook. The plan is to then move those important pages to "permanent storage" (perhaps this blog).
