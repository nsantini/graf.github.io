I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for a couple of years. And have really enjoyed it. But since my [[Self hosting mini weekend project]] I've been using [Docmost](https://docmost.com/), which is basically an open source [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) clone. Both have strengths and weaknesses. It's hard to make a final choice. But I suspect Obsidian will prevail in the long term, specially since now I'm also using it to manage my blog...
