title: Loss of momentum

Over the last couple of weeks, I've lost the little momentum I had in writing. The crunch of getting my handover done at my soon-to-be-ex-job got all the energy out of me. I had some glimpses of ideas about what to write about. I should pick up where I left on [[Handover documents]] and turn it into a post. But most of all, I should get back to the habit of reflecting on what I have learned or re-discovered over my week.
