I'm getting used to my new MoonLander keyboard. The hardest part is that it's full size and uses Cherry MX switches. So it's quite "big". Not sure if I will get fully onboard with it. Or if I will have to try to sell it and buy a smaller one, like the Voyager. Also, I can't justify spending more money on keyboards this year. Maybe next year?
