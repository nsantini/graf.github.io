In another case of procrastination, I'm giving the [Zen IDE](https://zed.dev/) another go. I like that it's fast, and that it has some LLM integrations without being *in your face* about it. I like to do some "vibe coding", but it's good to remove the distractions that are not needed. The question is, will I get used to the vim-style approach it has? With its 'shortcuts and minimal UI... Let's give it a go and see.
