The handover process is starting to pick up speed. As well as some sense of urgency on behalf of the founder. I believe this is the best for me. And it will benefit others in the company too, once they absorb the shock of the change. Half my notice period has passed, it's going to be crunch time for the next two weeks. Time to get working.
