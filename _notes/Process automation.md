Don't automate what you don't understand. This is a great succinct way to put what we deal with very often. Specially in the peak of hype cycles. Like the whole GenAI shenanigans we find ourselves in these days. The first thing to do is to understand what the process is, how the work it's done. And identify if there are things worth improving or in need of fixing. Don't throw solutions at non-existing problems. Do the leg-work to understand how things work, and you will uncover real opportunities for gain.
